## A hash of the GDP .pdf document was written to 9 blockchains

So, this is the "document hash", or "hash of the .pdf document". Basically, it's a unique fingerprint. If even one character in the .pdf changes... even one bit, the hash would also change.

The SHA-256 hash for the `gdp2q25-2nd.pdf` document is `c70972a12908b73c2407d9cc6842ba2a02203a690f3090cd29f30c45f0cfd93d`, and that value was put on the 9 different chains on August 28, 2026.
